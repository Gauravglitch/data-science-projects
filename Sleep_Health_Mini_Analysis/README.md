## About

This is a mini project aimed at practicing basic data analysis using a CSV dataset on sleep health.  
The project focuses on:
- Analyzing the ratio of sleep disorders across different BMI categories.
- Identifying occupations with the lowest average sleep quality and duration.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) as part of a learning exercise.  
It is used here purely for educational purposes and is not included in this repository.

## Analysis

### BMI Category vs Sleep Disorder
- Calculated the ratio of people with and without sleep disorders within each BMI category.

### Occupation Analysis
- Found the occupations with the lowest average sleep quality.
- Calculated the average sleep duration by occupation.

## Results

- Observations about the BMI and sleep disorder correlation.
- Listed occupations with relatively poor sleep metrics.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- VS Code with the Jupyter extension installed
- pandas

### Running the Analysis in VS Code
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sleep-health-mini-analysis.git
    cd sleep-health-mini-analysis
    ```
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Open the file `notebook.ipynb`.
4. Ensure you have the Python and Jupyter extensions installed in VS Code.
5. Run the cells directly inside VS Code.
