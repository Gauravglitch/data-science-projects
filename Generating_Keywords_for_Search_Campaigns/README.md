## Project Overview
This project demonstrates keyword generation for a search campaign prototype targeting the furniture retail sector. The task involves creating a targeted keyword strategy for an online furniture retailer's sofas section.

## Client Brief
**Client:** Online furniture retailer (low-cost/discount-focused)  
**Objective:** Generate high-quality keywords for search campaigns  
**Target Products:**
- Sofas
- Convertible sofas
- Love seats
- Recliners
- Sofa beds

## Strategy
- Focus on price-sensitive keywords (e.g., "buy," "discount," "cheap")
- Target budget-conscious customers
- Avoid luxury-related terminology
- Use exact and phrase match types for precise targeting

## Methodology
1. Generate modifier words relevant to the product category and customer intent
2. Combine modifiers with product names in multiple word orders
3. Organize keywords into campaigns and ad groups
4. Assign appropriate match types

## Output Format
The final deliverable is a structured DataFrame with the following columns:

| Campaign | Ad Group | Keyword | Criterion Type |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Campaign1 | AdGroup_1 | keyword 1a | Exact |
| Campaign1 | AdGroup_1 | keyword 1b | Exact |
